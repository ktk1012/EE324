I want to use delay token for PA2 Part3.

And i describe some logging policy because of some ambiguity.
In PDF, size is the size in bytes of the object that was returned.
I think it is size that received from end server. So in my program
save_log function, save log to proxy.log file, save size actually received from end server.
So if cache hits within an expires time, it writes size as 0,
and if received 304 Not modified header, it writes size of response header without actual data.
